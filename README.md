# Nonlinear minimization

## Things I'd like to do
* [ ] Implement a nonlinear minimization algorithm
* [ ] Create a suite of test functions
* [ ] Regression via Bayesian inference
* [ ] Regression via Boosted Decision Trees
* [ ] Regression via Neural Networks
* [ ] Optimize via Gurobi, a commercial optimization solver
* [ ] Optimize via SCIP, an open-source optimization solver
* [ ] Optimize via `scipy.optimize.minimize()`
    * [ ] Nelder-Mead
    * [ ] Powell
    * [ ] CG (conjugate gradient)
    

* [ ] Compare performance of different algorithms
* [ ] Gurobi nodes vs. runtime plot
* [ ] Massively parallel grid search
